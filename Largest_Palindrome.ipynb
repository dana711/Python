    "### Challenge: Largest Palindrome\n",
    "A palindromic number reads the same both ways. For example, 1234321 is a palindrome. The largest palindrome made from the product of two two-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two three-digit numbers. Afterward, write a brief explanation walking through your code's logic in markdown."
